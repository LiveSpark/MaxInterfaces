Thanks for purchasing a LiveSpark FirePixel, and welcome to a 
fantastic new world of possibilities in fire.

To begin, open the FirePixelSimpleControls.maxpat file using the program Max 6.
If you haven't already downloaded a copy of Max 6, you can find a trial version
here: http://cycling74.com/products/max/ (Cycling 74 is the company that makes Max).

After you open the file, follow the instructions on your screen.

We've done everything we can to make this interface as easy to use and fun
as possible, but if you have questions of any kind, please contact LiveSpark
support at: support@livesparkfire.com and we'll do our best to get back to
you with an answer right away.

Again, thanks very much for purchasing the most advanced flame effect in the world,
and be sure to send images and/or video of how you use your FirePixels!
