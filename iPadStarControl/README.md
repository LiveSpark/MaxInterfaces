iPadStarControl
=============

This max patch works in conjunction with the iOS demo showing a star touch interface that represents a circular layout of the FirePixels.
Touching the points on the star activates a single FirePixel, and touching nearer the center activates a set of FirePixels smoothly
modulating their amplitudes in correspondence to the gesture.
